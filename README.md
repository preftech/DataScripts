# DataScripts
SQL queries that extract data from various EMRs and ERPs and transform that data into a usable format for Preftech.

First, select the EMR or ERP that your health center uses.  Then, select the version of the Preftech Integration guide that you wish to use.  There you will find the SQL Scripts you can use as a baseline for extracting the correct data.
